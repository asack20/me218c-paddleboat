 When           Who     What/Why
 -------------- ---     --------
 02/27/17 09:48 jec      another correction to re-assign both CurrentEvent
                         and ReturnEvent to the result of the During function
                         this eliminates the need for the prior fix and allows
                         the during function to-remap an event that will be
                         processed at a higher level.
 02/20/17 10:14 jec      correction to Run function to correctly assign 
                         ReturnEvent in the situation where a lower level
                         machine consumed an event.
 02/03/16 12:38 jec      updated comments to reflect changes made in '14 & '15
                         converted unsigned char to bool where appropriate
                         spelling changes on true (was True) to match standard
                         removed local var used for debugger visibility in 'C32
                         commented out references to Start & RunLowerLevelSM so
                         that this can compile. 
 02/07/13 21:00 jec      corrections to return variable (should have been
                         ReturnEvent, not CurrentEvent) and several EV_xxx
                         event names that were left over from the old version
 02/08/12 09:56 jec      revisions for the Events and Services Framework Gen2
 02/13/10 14:29 jec      revised Start and run to add new kind of entry function
                         to make implementing history entry cleaner
 02/13/10 12:29 jec      added NewEvent local variable to During function and
                         comments about using either it or Event as the return
 02/11/10 15:54 jec      more revised comments, removing last comment in during
                         function that belongs in the run function
 02/09/10 17:21 jec      updated comments about internal transitions on During funtion
 02/18/09 10:14 jec      removed redundant call to RunLowerlevelSM in EV_Entry
                         processing in During function
 02/20/07 21:37 jec      converted to use enumerated type for events & states
 02/13/05 19:38 jec      added support for self-transitions, reworked
                         to eliminate repeated transition code
 02/11/05 16:54 jec      converted to implment hierarchy explicitly
 02/25/03 10:32 jec      converted to take a passed event parameter
 02/18/99 10:19 jec      built template from MasterMachine.c
 02/14/99 10:34 jec      Began Coding
